    <b>Lesson 4</b>
    <p>Question: What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?
      <hr>
      Answer: The benefits of building redundancy into a network is that it allows the system to be fault tolerant (fault tolerance is a process that enables an operating system to respond to a failure in hardware or software). An issue is time, as sometimes paths can take longer than others and so it would take a lot longer for the data to be sent to the user.</p>
