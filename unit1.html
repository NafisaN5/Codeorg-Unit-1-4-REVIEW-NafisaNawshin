  <b>Lesson 1</b>
    <p>Question: What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?
      <hr>
Answer: My strategies and insights about how to learn best is to get a good night sleep, eat a good breakfast, and then take notes of things I would not remember and also study topics I don't understand. These are similar to other students because they share the same idea of sleeping good and studying/taking notes. However, mine differs in the fact that I make sure to eat a good breakfast before school so I can stay focused.</p>

    <b>Lesson 2</b>
    <p>Question:Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?
      <hr>
      Answer: We only made a message device that sends a sequence of two options because it because it's easier. We can't make a device that has 30 different objects in it to all represent different things, that would take too long.</p>

    <b>Lesson 3</b>
    <p>Question: How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?
      <hr>
      Answer: I would explain that numbers go from 0-9 and after that, it goes from tens, to hundredths, to thousands and so on.</p>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson4">
    <b>Lesson 4</b>
    <p>Question: What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?
      <hr>
      Answer: Both binary and decimal uses the numbers 0 and 1 to give something a value. The difference is that the binary system uses 0 and 1 to represent numbers and is used for computer programing, while the decimal uses numbers 0-9 to represent its numbers.</p>

    <b>Lesson 5</b>
    <p>Question: When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?
      <hr>
      Answer: No, you cannot use bits to represent fractions of a number. You cannot do this because fractions are too small and cannot be represented.</p>
    </div>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson6">
    <b>Lesson 6</b>
    <p>Question: Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?
      <hr>
      Answer: I would sample the image by recreating it in a digital format and making it pixelized. I would sample the image to provide a good digital approximation by trying to make it as accurate to the original image as possible. I would use a sample size of 2x3 because that is half of the size of the original image and takes less data. This would affect the digital representation by making it have a lower quality.</p> 
    </div>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson7">
    <b>Lesson 7</b>
    <p>Question: Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.
      <hr>
      Answer: Sampling divides the image into pixels, and the quality of those pixels is determined by the amount of pixels the image has. RBG is used to repersent colors in binary, with 0 being the darkest and 255 being the brightest. Every image has RBG in them and is used in sampling to give the image color.</p>

    <b>Lesson 8</b>
    <p>Question: An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider. If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?
      <hr>
      Answer: I would tell them that nothing was delated, that I just took patterns I found in their book and repressed it into smaller words/symbols to make the bytes smaller. I would also let them know that this change can be reversable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson9">
    <b>Lesson 9</b>
    <p>Question: You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?
      <hr>
      Answer: Text messages and music, are best fit for lossless compression. This is because, you can take patterns from the text messages or music and then compress it into shorter symbols/letters that will keep the same information but use less bytes. Videos and images are lossy compression because you can lower the resolution for the video and image to use less bytes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson10">
    <b>Lesson 10</b>
    <p>Question: Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each. Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?
      <hr>
      Answer: I would have to allow my work to be used by others by licening my work as for comercial use.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson11">
    <b>Lesson 11</b>
    <p>Question: Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally? 
      <hr>
      Answer: We should care because there could be hackers that could hack into the internet and steal our information. This impacts me because I use the internet everyday so it's best to know how the internet works and how to avoid bad things.</p>
