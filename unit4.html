    <p>Question: Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?
      <hr>
      Answer: The process of creating and updating a variable is first, you name your variable using "var" and then you set a value to your variable. To update it, you type your variable, use the "=" and then put your new value in. The counter pattern with event works by increasing or decreasing the value with the set amount you have whenever you click it.</p>

    <p>Question: Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?
      <hr>
      Answer: Yes you can get a computer to evaluate an expression to something between true and false. You can write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer by using conditionals and if-else statements/adding probibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson6">
    <b>Lesson 6</b>
    <p>Question: When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below.
<br>
      What does it mean to put the most specific case first?
      <br>
      Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?
      <hr>
      Answer: o put the most specific case first, that means that you go from the highest number to the lowest number (ex: starting with 100 degrees temperature and saying it is 'extremely hot' instead of starting from the lowest temperature 60 and saying that it is 'cool'). The reason you want to do this is so the computer can go through that order and not mess things up. The types of errors this helps avoid is giving wrong information; for example, if you put temperature > 60 degrees first and then temperature > 80 degrees, the computer might say that 82 degrees is "cool" since it is higher than 60 degrees, when instead it should be "warm".</p>
